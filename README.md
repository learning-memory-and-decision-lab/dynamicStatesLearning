# dynamicStatesLearning

Code for : Razmi & Nassar (2022). "Adaptive Learning through Temporal Dynamics of State Representation."

All scripts are written in Matlab and were run by Matlab 2021b.

The main analysis codes are in:

changepoint_condition_main.m

oddBall_condition_main.m

changepoint_condition_main code should produce the results and plots related to figures 2 , 3 and 4 in the paper and oddBall_condition_main will produce the relevents results and plots for figure 6. For the analysis used in figure 7 , run the pupil_response_simulation.m after running the two main codes above first. Please don't hesitate to reach out to NR, in case of more questions.

Running the scripts  will require downloading the behavioral dataset "McGuireNassar2014data" from Nassar lab website : https://sites.brown.edu/mattlab/resources/
